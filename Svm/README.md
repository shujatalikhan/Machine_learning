# Suppot Vector Machine
### Support vector machines (SVMs) are a popular linear classifier, the current version of which was developed by Vladimir Vapnik and Corinna Cortes .SVMs are supervised learning models, meaning sample data must be labeled, that can be applied to almost any type of data.  

### They are especially effective at classification, numeral prediction, and pattern recognition tasks. SVMs find a line (or hyperplane in dimensions greater than 2) in between different classes of data such that the distance on either side of that line or hyperplane to the next-closest data points is maximized.

### In other words, support vector machines calculate a maximum-margin boundary that leads to a homogeneous partition of all data points. This classifies an SVM as a maximum margin classifier.
### On the edge of either side of a margin lies sample data labeled as support vectors
