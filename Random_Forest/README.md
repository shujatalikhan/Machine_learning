# Random Forest 
### Random forest algorithm is a supervised classification algorithm. As the name suggest, this algorithm creates the forest with a number of trees.
## Random Advantages:
 * The same random forest algorithm or the random forest classifier can use for both classification and the regression task.
 * Random forest classifier will handle the missing values
 * When we have more trees in the forest, random forest classifier wonâ€™t overfit the model.
 * Can model the random forest classifier for categorical values also.
