# What is Machine Learning ?
### **Machine Learning at its most basic is the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.**
## **Types of machine learning Algorithms**

 * **Supervised learning**
 * **Unsupervised Learning**
 * **Semi-supervised Learning**
 * **Reinforcement Learning**
## Supervised learning

### Supervised learning algorithms try to model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features such that we can predict the output values for new data based on those relationships which it learned from the previous data sets.

## List of Common Algorithms
* Nearest Neighbor
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Trees
* Linear Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Neural Networks

## Unsupervised Learning

### Unsupervised Learning are the family of machine learning algorithms which are mainly used in pattern detection and descriptive modeling. However, there are no output categories or labels here based on which the algorithm can try to model relationships. These algorithms try to use techniques on the input data to mine for rules, detect patterns, and summarize and group the data points which help in deriving meaningful insights and describe the data better to the users.

## List of Common Algorithms
* k-means clustering

## Semi-supervised Learning

### In the previous two types, either there are no labels for all the observation in the dataset or labels are present for all the observations. Semi-supervised learning falls in between these two. In many practical situations, the cost to label is quite high, since it requires skilled human experts to do that. So, in the absence of labels in the majority of the observations but present in few, semi-supervised algorithms are the best candidates for the model building. These methods exploit the idea that even though the group memberships of the unlabeled data are unknown, this data carries important information about the group parameters.

## Reinforcement Learning

### Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning, and thereby also a branch of Artificial Intelligence. It allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context, in order to maximize its performance.

## List of Common Algorithms
* Q-Learning
* Temporal Difference (TD)
* Deep Adversarial Networks
